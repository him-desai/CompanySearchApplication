First I will Write Repo/BackEnd layer to Call API and to get the data.
Then I will convert this data into JAVA Object.
Then I will Merge the Response by filtering Officer whose resign is null.
Then I will Store this data to database.
I will write the test cases along side so it will be helpful.
 ( Now After Ending the session I can see  many
tests cases are still left but due to time issue I will keep basic tests for now to give idea that
I have understanding of it. - Himanshu
